Development will continue soon, but for now the project is on pause.  
Thank you for your patience!

## Addons

### Twitch Chat Addon (BETA - Work in Progress)
This addon lets your Twitch chat interact directly with the AI! Think of it as giving your viewers a voice inside your VTuber's world. It's still under heavy development, so expect some wonky bits. 😅

#### Current Status:
- ✅ **Audio Playback**: The AI can hear and respond to your chat's messages.
- ❌ **Movement**: The visual aspect of the VTuber reacting to chat is currently broken.

### Discord VTuber App (BETA)
A second companion project built in Electron that brings your AI VTuber to Discord! This app lets your VTuber **speak and text through a Discord bot** using AI-generated voice responses.

#### Features:
- 🎙️ Uses AI voice to speak directly in Discord voice channels. (still work in progress)
- 🤖 Works with a custom bot for seamless interaction.
- 🧪 Currently in beta – some features might still be a bit experimental!

#### Demo:
